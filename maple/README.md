# Maple

Welcome to the `maple` folder of the `Sandals` project. In this folder, you can find the Maple package that can be used for both ODEs/DAEs systems analysis, manipulation, and code generation of efficient C++ code for the integrator available in this repository.

## Installation

To install the `Sandals` module you must have first installed Maple. Then open the `PackAndGo.mw` file and use the `!!!` button to *execute the entire worksheet*.

Then test the module in a Maple worksheet or document by typing:

```
> Sandals:-Info(Sandals); # For Maple versions up to 2020
> Sandals:-Info();        # For Maple versions starting from 2021 onwards
```

Alternatively, you can use one of the tests file provided in the `tests` folder. If the module is loaded without errors, it is done!

## Module description

If you want a full description of the `Sandals` package type:

```
> Describe(Sandals);
> Describe(SandalsCodeGen);
> Describe(SandalsUtils);
```

This command will generate a brief description of the module and all the procedures and other objects present in the `Sandals.mpl`, `SandalsCodeGen.mpl`, and `SandalsUtils.mpl` files.


## Usage

In case you have no time to read the description and realize how it should or should not work, refer to the files in the `tests` folder.

### ðŸš§ Attention! ðŸš§

Maple object-oriented programming features have slightly changed in 2021, which online documentation states:

> As of Maple 2021, if the method has a formal parameter named `_self`, references to its object's local or exported variables may be written without prefixing them. That is, `_self:-variable` may be written as just `variable`. Maple will add the `self:-` prefix internally when the method is simplified.

> As of Maple 2021, a message-passing form of method call can be used, which will automatically pass the object as an argument if the method has a formal parameter named `_self`.

> Another way to invoke a method, similar to that used in other object-oriented languages, was introduced in Maple 2021. In this form, the object name is qualified by the method name, `object_name:-method_name(argument)` just as it can be in the function mechanism described above. However, the *object can be omitted from the argument sequence*.
